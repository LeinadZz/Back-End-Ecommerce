## User Story

    AS A manager at an internet retail company
    I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
    SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Installation

This application uses multiple packages, so be sure to 
use `npm install` before running.

## Usage

To run the application, use `node server`.

You will then be able to test endpoints with a tester tool, such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

```bash
  Fork Repository
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Back-End-Ecommerce
```

Install dependencies

  npm install
```
Seed the data

```bash
  npm run seed
```

Run the Server

```bash
  node server
```
